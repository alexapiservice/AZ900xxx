# 04 - Create a virtual network

In this walkthrough, we will create a virtual network, deploy two virtual machines onto that virtual network and then configure them to allow one virtual machine to ping the other within that virtual network.

# Task 1: Create a virtual network

In this task, we will create a virtual network. 

1. Sign in to the Azure portal at <a href="https://portal.azure.com" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">https://portal.azure.com</span></a>

2. From the **All services** blade, search for and select **Virtual networks**, and then click **+ Add**. 

3. On the **Create virtual network** blade, fill in the following (leave the defaults for everything else):

    | Setting | Value | 
    | --- | --- |
    | Name | **vnet1** |
    | Address space |**10.1.0.0/16** |
    | Subscription | **Select your subscription** |
    | Resource group | **myRGVNet** (create new) |
    | Location | **(US) East US** |
    | Subnet - Name | **default** |
    | Subnet Address range | **10.1.0.0/24** |

    ![Screenshot of the "IP Addresses" step of Create virtual network blade with the default fields.](../images/0301b.png)

5. Click the **Review + create** button. Ensure the validation passes.

6. Click the **Create** button to deploy the virtual network. 

    **Note**: In your organization, how will you know which virtual networks and IP addressing you will need?

# Task 2: Create two virtual machines

In this task, we will create two virtual machines in the virtual network. 

1. From the **All services** blade, search for **Virtual machines** and then click **+ Add**. 

2. On the **Basics** tab, fill in the following information (leave the defaults for everything else):

   | Setting | Value | 
   | --- | --- |
   | Subscription | **Choose your subscription**  |
   | Resource group |  **myRGVNet** |
   | Virtual machine name | **vm1**|
   | Region | **(US) East US** |
   | Image | **Windows Server 2019 Datacenter** |
   | Username| **azureuser** |
   | Password| **Pa$$w0rd1234** |
   | Public inbound ports| Select **Allow selected ports**  |
   | Selected inbound ports| **RDP (3389)** |
   |||

3. Select the **Networking** tab. Make sure the virtual machine is placed in the vnet1 virtual network. Review the default settings, but do not make any other changes. 

   | Setting | Value | 
   | --- | --- |
   | Virtual network | **vnet1** |
   |||

4. Click **Review + create**. After the Validation passes, click **Create**. Deployment times can vary but it can generally take between three to six minutes to deploy.

5. Monitor your deployment, but continue on to the next step. 

6. Create a second virtual machine by repeating steps **2 to 4** above. Make sure you use a different virtual machine name, that the virtual machine is within the same virtual network, and is using a new public IP address:

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Resource group | **myRGVNet** |
    | Virtual machine name |  **vm2** |
    | Virtual network | **vnet1** |
    | Public IP | (new) **vm2-ip** |
    |||

7. Wait for both virtual machines to deploy. 

# Task 3: Test the connection 

In this task, we will allow ICMP connections and test whether the virtual machines can communicate (ping) each other. 

1. From the **All resources** blade, search for **vm1**, open its **Overview** blade, and make sure its **Status** is **Running**. You may need to **Refresh** the page.

2. On the **Overview** blade, click the **Connect** button.

    **Note**: The following directions tell you how to connect to your VM from a Windows computer. 

3. On the **Connect to virtual machine** blade, keep the default options to connect by IP address over port 3389 and click **Download RDP File**.

4. Open the downloaded RDP file and click **Connect** when prompted. 

5. In the **Windows Security** window, type the username **azureuser** and password **Pa$$w0rd1234** and then click **OK**.

6. You may receive a certificate warning during the sign-in process. Click **Yes** or to create the connection and connect to your deployed VM. You should connect successfully.

7. Open up a PowerShell command prompt on the virtual machine, by clicking the **Start** button, typing **PowerShell**, right clicking **Windows PowerShell** in the right-click menu, and clicking **Run as administrator**

8. Try to ping vm2 (make sure vm2 is running). You will receive an error, saying request timed out.  The `ping` fails, because `ping` uses the **Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)**. By default, ICMP isn't allowed through the Windows firewall.


   ```PowerShell
   ping vm2
   ```
   
   ![Screenshot of PowerShell command prompt with the command ping vm2 after its completion and the output indicating the command wasn't successful.](../images/0302.png)

    **Note**: You will now open an RDP session to vm2 and allow incoming ICMP connections

9. Connect to **vm2** using RDP. You can follow steps **2 to 6**.

10. Open a **PowerShell** prompt and allow ICMP. This command allows ICMP inbound connections through the Windows firewall.

   ```PowerShell
   New-NetFirewallRule –DisplayName “Allow ICMPv4-In” –Protocol ICMPv4
   ```
   ![Screenshot of PowerShell command prompt with the command New-NetFirewallRule DisplayName Allow ICMPv4-In –Protocol ICMPv4 after its completion and the output indicating the command was successful.](../images/0303.png)

   **Note**: You will now switch to the RDP session to vm1 and try the ping again

11. Return to the RDP session to vm1 and try the ping again. You should now be successful. 

   ```PowerShell
   ping vm2
   ```

Congratulations! You have configured and deployed two virtual machines in a virtual network. You have also configured the Windows firewall so one of the virtual machines allows incoming ping requests. 

**Note**: To avoid additional costs, you can remove this resource group. Search for resource groups, click your resource group, and then click **Delete resource group**. Verify the name of the resource group and then click **Delete**. Monitor the **Notifications** to see how the delete is proceeding.
